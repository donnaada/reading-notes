- How would you describe events to a non-technical friend?
  - An event are things that happened to the browser while programming ie `onload()` and  `onclick`

- When using the addEventListener() method, what 2 arguments will you need to provide?
  - what the event needs to listen for, and a function that runs when that event happens

- Describe the event object. Why is the target within the event object useful?
  - a parameter inside an event handler
