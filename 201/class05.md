The topics covered in the reading are important to get an understanding more of how we can make our site more accessible to the public and visually appealing

## Learning HTML

- What is a real world use case for the alt attribute being used in a website?
  - The alt attribute displays a description of the image and is used in the event that an image cannot load. It is also there for the visually impared users who use a screen reader to read out the image.

## Git Branching

`Main Branch` is the production branch

### Feature Branch

Reviewed first then merged into main using Pull Request.

### Fun With Functions

create template first

1. git clone (Main on Github)
2. Create a feature branch called `sum` - `git checkout -b sum`
3. Write code
4. Add and Commit
5. push to github on `sum branch` - git push origin sum
6. open PR from sum on main on github
7. `git checkout main` to switch back to main branch
8. run `git pull origin main` to get all the change
