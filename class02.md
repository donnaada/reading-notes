## Choosing a Text Editor
There is no right or wrong choice when it comes to picking the best text editor. It ends up just being personal preference however there are 4 **important** features too look for.
- Code Completion
- Syntax Highlighting
- Theme Options
- A variety of Extentions readily available

## CLI Commands
- `pwd` - Shows where you are or what directory you are in.
- `ls` - shows a list of all the things in our current location
- `cd` - allows us to change our current location by typing the command followed by the location ie `cd [location`]
- `mkdir` - Creates a directory in our current location. Need to specify the new directory name after command ie `mkdir [directory_name]`
- `touch` - Creates a file in our current location. File name needs to be specified after the command ie `touch fileName.md`
- `rm` - removes file. File name needs to be specified after command
<!-- - `rm -rf` - removes the folder. ***MAKE SURE TO ADD FOLDER NAME AFTER OR ALL FILES ON COMPUTER WILL BE DELETED***-->

## What is happening in the following scenarios.

1. `cd projects` - We are 'moving our location' or changing our directory location to the **projects** Folder
2. `mkdir new-project` - We are creating a new folder in the projects folder called **new-project** 
3. `touch new-project/newfile.md` - In the new-project folder, we are creating a Markdown File called newfile
4. `cd ..` - We are going back one level and will be in the projects folder.
5. `ls projects/new-project` - We are listing all the items that are in the new-project directory/folder
