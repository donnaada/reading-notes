# 🗒️ Class 03: Revisions and the Cloud

## What is Version Control?
Version Control is a system that allows the user to see all changes made to a file or set of files. Additionally, a user can choose to revert back to the previous or older version of a project.

## What is `cloning` in Git?
Cloning a repository is another way of saying creating a copy. Not only are the files copied, but all the versions of the project as well.

## What is the command to track and stage files?
If we are only wanting to track ***one file***, the command we would use is `git add filename`. 

To track ***ALL*** files, use command `$ git add*` 

## What is the command to send your changed files to Github?
One we are done tracking and staging files, you must commit the file and/or changes made and the push.

> Commiting a file can be done using the following code `$ git commit -m "commit comment goes here".`
To commit all changes made, enter the following code `$ git push origin master`
