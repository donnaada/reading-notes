# Prep: The Growth Mindset

## Upgrade Your Technical Skills with Deliberate Practice 

- Coding everyday doesn't automatically equal getting better everyday. Working towards strengthening our technical skills is what makes us better. Deliberate practice means coding while pushing ourselves outside our comfort level and repeating that process over and over again. It also means coding and asking for feedback to get better. 

## Carol Dweck on the Growth Mindset

- The power of YET. Getting a failing grade is usually associated with the thoughts of not being good enough or not having the capability of understaning a concept or topic but getting a 'Not Yet' grade just means that you are at a learning curve and dont understand it yet but will in the future. Teaching or raising a family with the Growth mindset in mind will greatly improve the child's growth process. They learn to approach a situation with knowing that while it may be a little hard, they are more than capable of overcoming it.

## Angela Lee Duckworth on Grit

- Grit is passion and perseverence. It is the key to success, not where you come from and not your IQ. Talent doesn't make you Gritty. The growth mindset is great for building grit becuase those who understand the growth mindset know that failure is not a permanent position. 

## Alain de Botton on Redefining Success

- We are told from a very young age that we can achieve anything so when we don't achieve everything we hope for, we think we have failed. We don't fear failing itself, but more so we fear how society will see us. Envy is another problem in our society. The spiirit of equality teaches us that we are all equal. So when someone who you are closer to in age, background, or history, has a bigger house or a newer car, we become envious of them because we begin to compare our lives to theirs and associate that with being more successful than the other.
