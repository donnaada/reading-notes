## Reading

  - Node is a Javascript Runtime that essentially allows the user to run javascript application outside of a browser. You can think of it like watching a preview of a Netflix movie without the need to click on the movie just yet. 

- What does it mean that Node is a JavaScript runtime?
  - It simply means that Node.js is a program that uses Javascript to execute the code. 

- What is Node used for?
  - Node is used to allow us to run JavaScript on a server different from how traditional servers and languages runs our code. With the more traditional method, the server has to wait for code to execute before processing result where as with Node, it does everything asynchronously, meaning it processes the next event in a code even if it is still waiting for the previous code to respond back to the prior request.
