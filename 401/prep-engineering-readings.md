# 🗒️ Prep: Engineering Readings

## Discussion Questions

1. What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?
    - To say that I have something to offer that no other person in this class or in the tech world could is kind of a stretch. What I do bring to the table is the enthusiasm and willingess to learn, the motivation to ensure the success of a project and the company, and the ability to admit when I am wrong or do not know something. 
1. What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?
    - Follow the 15 minute rule, if i cant figure it out, ask for help and move forward.
    - Break the code into smaller more managable chunks that would be easier to tackle than one big block of code.
    - Step away from the code for a little bit then come back to in with a clearer mind and new outlook.
