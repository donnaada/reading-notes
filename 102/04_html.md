* An Opening tag -  ***`<p>`*** <- This is a Paragraph Opening Tag
* The Content of the element (What goes in between the tags)
* Closing tag - ***`</p>`*** <- Closing Tags is usually the same as the opening tags except that it has a `/` before the element name.

### What is it called when you give an element extra information?

When you give an element extra information, that is called giving it an attribute.

### what is a semantic Element?

## Wireframes

Wireframes is pretty much the blueprint or layout of a website.

Three key principals of wireframes are:

* Clarity - What is the site page about, what can the user do on that page, and does it satisfy their needs?
* Confidence - Is it easy to navigate through the site and are the Call-to-Action sections clear to the user?
* Simplicity - Too much information on the page can really distract a user and will affect the experience. The goal is to have the users be able to find their way through a site with ease.
