**JavaScript (JS)** is a scripting langue used on websites and other non-browser applications.

## What are variables in JavaScript?

Variables are containers used to store data.

## What does it mean to declare a variable?

When we delcare a variable, we are telling the computer that we have a container that we will be using to store things. The 4 ways we declare variables in JavaScript are:

* `var`: `var a = 1` - Same as `let` but this is used if we want our code to run in browsers (2015 and older)
* `let`: `let a = 1` - We use `let` for variables that can change
* `const`: `const a = 1` - Use `const` on variables that cannot be changed
* Using nothing: `a = 1`

## What is an ‚Äúassignment‚Äù operator, and what does it do?

The assignment operator assigns a value to the variable.

[You can find examples of JS Assignments here.](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_assignment.asp)

## What is information received from the user called?

Information received from the user is called the input. a couple of ways to get input include the `prompt()` which asks for users to type stuff into a textbox and `confirm()` which asks a user to confirm (returns a value `true` or cancel which returns a value of `false`).
